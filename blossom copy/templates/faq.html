  <h1>Frequently Asked Questions</h1>
  <br>
  <h4>Q: What is Alzheimers disease and how does it differ from the dementia?</h4>
  <p>A: “Dementia” and “Alzheimer’s disease” are often used interchangeably, but they are different. “Dementia” is an umbrella term for a variety of diseases and conditions that develop when nerve cells in the brain no longer function properly. Symptoms of dementia include changes in one’s behavior or judgment, memory, and ability to plan activities and finish tasks. Alzheimer’s disease is the most common type of dementia, at 60-80%. With Alzheimer’s disease, changes in the brain eventually affect basic bodily functions such as walking and swallowing. There are over 100 types of dementia.  After Alzheimer’s disease, the most common form is vascular dementia from tiny, almost imperceptible strokes, at up to 20%. Some researchers believe that up to 45% of dementias are “mixed dementia”—Alzheimer’s disease plus another dementia. Other types of dementia include dementia from Parkinson’s disease, Frontotemporal dementia, and Lewy Body dementia. “Early onset” occurs before age 60, and comprises 5-7% of Alzheimer’s disease cases.

  <h4>Q: Is Alzheimer’s hereditary?</h4>
  <p>A: In Familial (early-onset) Alzheimer’s (5-7% of Alzheimer’s cases), gene mutations cause a cascade of effects in the brain leading to increased amyloid, a protein that many researchers believe plays a role in the development of Alzheimer’s disease. If one parent carries the mutated gene, the child has a 50% chance of developing the disease; if both parents carry the gene, the risk increases to 75% percent.
  In Alzheimer’s disease over age sixty, there is something called a “risk factor” gene—APOE ε4 allele. This gene increases your risk somewhat if you inherit it from your parents. According to the National Institute on Aging, “Some people with one or two APOE ε4 alleles never get the disease, and others who develop Alzheimer’s do not have any APOE ε4 alleles". For that reason a blood test for the allele is not recommended for people at risk for Alzheimer’s disease.
  Some studies suggest that you are more likely to develop Alzheimer’s disease if you mother had it.
  </p>
  <br>
  <h4>Q: Is there any way I can reduce my risk of developing dementia?</h4>
  <p>A: There are no proven ways to prevent Alzheimer’s disease. Take heart, however. Research suggests many ways you may be able to reduce your risk: </p>
  <br>
  <p>Exercise</p>
  <p> Put down your Sudoku puzzle and go for a walk.
  Some researchers say that exercise may be our most powerful antidote for dementia. The Alzheimer’s Association recommends 30 minutes of daily exercise. A study by neurologists at Rush University Medical Center shows that daily activity of all kinds—from formal exercise to activities such as washing dishes, cleaning, and cooking—may reduce the risk of developing Alzheimer’s disease, even in people over age 80. In another study, subjects who walked forty minutes a day for a year regained volume in their hippocampus, reversing brain shrinkage. In a third study, people with mild cognitive impairment who did resistance weight training two times a week over six months showed an increase in their memory and executive function (the ability to multi-task).
  </p>
  <br>
  <p>Most Common Risk Factors</p>
  <p> If you can, try to avoid the most common risk factors for Alzheimers. In addition to factors you can’t control, such as a family history of Alzheimer’s, these risk factors include serious head trauma; poor cardiovascular health; high blood pressure; stroke; diabetes; high cholesterol; obesity in middle age; and smoking. To that list I’d add two lesser-known risk factors:  sleep apnea and high blood sugar levels. Both sleep apnea and pre-diabetes (blood sugar levels that are normal but high) are woefully under-diagnosed, so if you suspect that you have either, please get tested. Both conditions affect the health of your brain. </p>
  <br>
  <p>Diet and Dementia</p>
  <p> As far as diet is concerned, there is little agreement on what exactly will help prevent dementia, though doctors say that what is good for the body is good for the brain. (In this article I argue for a low-carb diet.) And no dietary supplements have been proven to reduce the risk of dementia, though there is anecdotal evidence that coconut oil may be helpful.</p>
  <br>
  <p>Social and Mental Stimulation</p>
  <p>Social activity and mental stimulation are crucial. Combining social activity and mental stimulation with regular exercise is more effective than doing only one or the other. Sports, cultural activities, emotional support, and close personal relationships are all key. We should work as long as we can, volunteer, join social clubs, and travel. We should turn off the television, read, write, do crosswords and puzzles. Play games, do memory exercises, learn a new language, or learn to play an instrument.</p>

  <h4>Q: What type of treatment can be done for someone with Alzheimer’s?</h4>
  <p>A: There is a wide array of available treatments to ameliorate the symptoms of Alzheimer's.</p>

  <br>
  <p>Creating a Safe and Supportive Environment</p>
  <p>Adapting the living situation to the needs of a person with Alzheimer's is an important part of any treatment plan. For someone with Alzheimer's, establishing and strengthening routine habits and minimizing memory-demanding tasks can make life much easier.</p>
  <p>You can take these steps to support a person's sense of well-being and continued ability to function:</p>
  <p>
  Always keep keys, wallets, mobile phones and other valuables in the same place at home, so they don't become lost.
  See if your doctor can simplify your medication regimen to once-daily dosing, and arrange for your finances to be on automatic payment and automatic deposit.
  Develop the habit of carrying a mobile phone with location capability so that you can call in case you are lost or confused and people can track your location via the phone. Also, program important phone numbers into your phone, so you don't have to try to recall them.
  Make sure regular appointments are on the same day at the same time as much as possible.
  Use a calendar or whiteboard in the home to track daily schedules. Build the habit of checking off completed items so that you can be sure they were completed.
  Remove excess furniture, clutter and throw rugs.
  Install sturdy handrails on stairways and in bathrooms.
  Ensure that shoes and slippers are comfortable and provide good traction.
  Reduce the number of mirrors. People with Alzheimer's may find images in mirrors confusing or frightening.
  Keep photographs and other meaningful objects around the house.
  </p>
  <br>
  <p>Drugs</p>
  <p>Current Alzheimer's medications can help for a time with memory symptoms and other cognitive changes. Two types of drugs are currently used to treat cognitive symptoms: </p>
  <p>Cholinesterase inhibitors. These drugs work by boosting levels of a cell-to-cell communication by providing a neurotransmitter (acetylcholine) that is depleted in the brain by Alzheimer's disease. The improvement is modest. Cholinesterase inhibitors can improve neuropsychiatric symptoms, such as agitation or depression, as well.</p>
  <p>Commonly prescribed cholinesterase inhibitors include donepezil (Aricept), galantamine (Razadyne) and rivastigmine (Exelon). The main side effects of these drugs include diarrhea, nausea, loss of appetite and sleep disturbances. In people with cardiac conduction disorders, serious side effects may include a slow heart rate and heart block.</p>
  <p>Memantine (Namenda). This drug works in another brain cell communication network and slows the progression of symptoms with moderate to severe Alzheimer's disease. It's sometimes used in combination with a cholinesterase inhibitor. Side effects may include constipation, dizziness and headache.
  Sometimes other medications such as antidepressants are used to help control the behavioral symptoms associated with Alzheimer's disease. But some medications should only be used with great caution. For example, some common sleep medications — zolpidem (Ambien), eszopiclone (Lunesta) and others — may increase confusion and the risk of falls.</p>
  <p>Anti-anxiety medications — clonazepam (Klonopin) and lorazepam (Ativan) — increase the risk of falls, confusion and dizziness. Always check with your doctor before taking any new medications.</p>
  <br>
  <p>Exercise</p>
  <p>Regular exercise is an important part of everybody's wellness plan — and those with Alzheimer's are no exception. Activities such as a daily walk can help improve mood and maintain the health of joints, muscles and the heart.</p>
  <p>Exercise can also promote restful sleep and prevent constipation. Make sure that the person with Alzheimer's carries identification or wears a medical alert bracelet if she or he walks unaccompanied.</p>
  <p>People with Alzheimer's who develop trouble walking may still be able to use a stationary bike or participate in chair exercises. You may be able to find exercise programs geared to older adults on TV or on DVDs.</p>
  <br>
  <p>Nutrition</p>
  <p>People with Alzheimer's may forget to eat, lose interest in preparing meals or not eat a healthy combination of foods. They may also forget to drink enough, leading to dehydration and constipation.</p>
  <p>Offer: High-calorie, healthy shakes and smoothies. You can supplement milkshakes with protein powders (available at grocery stores, drugstores and discount retailers) or use your blender to make smoothies featuring your favorite ingredients.
  Water, juice and other healthy beverages. Try to ensure that a person with Alzheimer's drinks at least several full glasses of liquids every day. Avoid beverages with caffeine, which can increase restlessness, interfere with sleep and trigger a frequent need to urinate.
  Certain nutritional supplements are marketed as "medical foods" specifically to treat Alzheimer's disease. The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) does not approve products marketed as medical foods. Despite marketing claims, there's no definitive data showing that any of these supplements is beneficial or safe.</p>
  <br>
  <h4>Q: How do I cope and support?</h4>
  <p>A: People with Alzheimer's disease experience a mixture of emotions — confusion, frustration, anger, fear, uncertainty, grief and depression.</p>
  <p>If you're caring for someone with Alzheimer's, you can help them cope with the disease by being there to listen, reassuring the person that life can still be enjoyed, providing support, and doing your best to help the person retain dignity and self-respect.</p>
  <p>A calm and stable home environment can help reduce behavior problems. New situations, noise, large groups of people, being rushed or pressed to remember, or being asked to do complicated tasks can cause anxiety. As a person with Alzheimer's becomes upset, the ability to think clearly declines even more.</p>
  <br>
  <p>Caring for the Caregiver</p>
  <p> Caring for a person with Alzheimer's disease is physically and emotionally demanding. Feelings of anger and guilt, stress and discouragement, worry and grief, and social isolation are common. Caregiving can even take a toll on the caregiver's physical health. But paying attention to your own needs and well-being is one of the most important things you can do for yourself and for the person with Alzheimer's. If you're a caregiver for someone with Alzheimer's, you can help yourself by:</p>
  <br>
  <p>Learning as Much About the Disease as You Can</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Asking questions of doctors, social workers and others involved in the care of your loved one</li>
    <li>Calling on friends or other family members for help when you need it</li>
    <li>Taking a break every day</li>
    <li>Spending time with your friends</li>
    <li>Taking care of your health by seeing your own doctors on schedule, eating healthy meals and getting exercise</li>
    <li>Joining a support group</li>
    <li>Making use of a local adult day center, if possible</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Many people with Alzheimer's and their families benefit from counseling or local support services. Contact your local Alzheimer's Association affiliate to connect with support groups, doctors, occupational therapists, resources and referrals, home care agencies, residential care facilities, a telephone help line, and educational seminars.</p>
